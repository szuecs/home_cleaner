= HomeCleaner

== DESCRIPTION

home_cleaner deletes user directories on a Mac OS X computer when they are old 
enough and not blacklisted or not logged in. This can be useful for 
maintaining a pc lab.
Maybe you can achieve the same with UNIX find(1). The following could be 
sufficient: 

  find /Users/* -maxdepth 0 -mtime +7 -type d -not -name Shared | xargs -n1 rm -rf

== SYNOPSIS

  % home_cleaner
  clean(user1)
  clean(user2)
  remove /Users/user2
  clean(admin)
  clean(user3)
  remove /Users/user3
  ...
